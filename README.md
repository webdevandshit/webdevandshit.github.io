# Blog

If you have any corrections (grammaticall, syntactical, spelling, profanity) please create a pull and then go fuck yourself. 

# Insults

Its a fucking blog and nobody gives a shit what are your thoughts or if you feel insulted. If you dont like it don't read it.

# Tech stuff

I am no expert, so everything I write take it with a pinch of salt. Don't go and implement it on your employers fucking codebase
without doing research, proving the concept, benchmarking it and writing a good test harness you fucking muppet!!! You never know
it might be a trap, I might want to get you fired...
